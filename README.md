# javafx.icons
Custom fork of an old repo I clonedÂ  long time ago from the FontAwesomeFx project, it was for Java 8. I found it today on my old hard drive and updated it for Java 17+.
So all credit goes to those guys who created the project.
I changed some names and packages, but the usage is basically the same as the original project.
